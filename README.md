:: This is the command sequence for Windows cmd.exe

:: Step 1: Clone the repository (This Git command is the same on all systems)
:: Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crm-authentication-module.git

:: Step 2: Navigate into the new project directory
cd crm-authentication-module

:: Step 3: Create the directory structure using Windows backslash syntax
:: The standard 'mkdir' or 'md' command in Windows can create nested directories.
mkdir public\css
mkdir public\js
mkdir appsscript

:: Step 4: Create the empty files using the correct Windows command ('type nul >')
type nul > README.md
type nul > .gitignore
type nul > public\index.html
type nul > public\reset-password.html
type nul > public\css\style.css
type nul > public\js\main.js
type nul > public\js\apiService.js
type nul > public\js\auth.js
type nul > appsscript\Code.gs
type nul > appsscript\AuthLogic.gs
type nul > appsscript\UserManagement.gs
type nul > appsscript\appsscript.json

:: Step 5: Add content to .gitignore
:: Note: Git understands forward slashes in .gitignore files even on Windows, so this is fine.
echo node_modules/ > .gitignore
echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore

:: Step 6: Stage, commit, and push your new project structure (Git commands are the same)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up project structure"
git push -u origin main
This sequence will now execute correctly in the Windows Command Prompt. Thank you for your patience and for providing the exact error message, which made it clear what the underlying issue was.

Excellent. Those are the correct commands to finalize the setup.

Running that sequence will perform the following actions:

git add .: Stages all the new files and directories you created.
git commit -m "...": Saves the staged files as a new version (a "commit") in your local project history with the message "Initial commit: Set up project structure".
git push -u origin main: Uploads your local commit to your remote repository on GitHub, making the project structure live.
After you run these commands successfully, your GitHub repository will contain the complete file structure.

As a next step to confirm everything is working, you can add some basic code to your main login page.

Example for public/index.html:

You can open the public/index.html file and paste this basic HTML structure into it.

HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CRM Login</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CRM Client Login Page</h1>
    <p>Project is successfully set up and this page is live.</p>
    <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
After saving this change, you can push it to GitHub using a new commit:

DOS

git add public/index.html
git commit -m "feat: Add initial boilerplate to index.html"
git push
Your project is now perfectly set up for you to begin development on the front-end and the Apps Script backend.

This is a permission error. The GitHub account your computer is using (fingergunsDEV) has been denied permission to write to the repository owned by the madebyJasonGibson account.

The Error: 403 code means "Forbidden," confirming that your request was understood but rejected due to a lack of permissions.

Why This Happens
Git uses credentials saved on your computer to authenticate with GitHub. In this case, your computer is telling GitHub, "I am the user fingergunsDEV," but the owner of the repository (madebyJasonGibson) has not given the fingergunsDEV user access to make changes.

How to Fix It
Choose the option below that matches your situation.

Option 1: You need to be added as a collaborator.
This is the correct option if madebyJasonGibson is another person or a different GitHub account you own. The owner of the repository must grant you permission.

Steps for the repository owner (madebyJasonGibson):

Go to the madebyJasonGibson/crm-authentication-module repository on GitHub.
Click on the Settings tab.
In the left sidebar, click Collaborators and teams.
Click the green Add people button.
Enter the username fingergunsDEV and click Add fingergunsDEV to this repository.
Ensure you grant Write access.
The fingergunsDEV account must then accept the collaboration invitation sent via email or on GitHub.
Option 2: You're logged into the wrong account on your PC.
This is the correct option if you are the owner (madebyJasonGibson) but your computer is using old or incorrect credentials (fingergunsDEV). You need to update your saved credentials on Windows.

Steps to update your credentials:

Press the Windows Key, type Credential Manager, and press Enter.
Click on Windows Credentials.
Look for an entry named git:https://github.com in the list.
Click on it to expand, and then click Remove.
Now, go back to your command prompt and run the push command again:
DOS

git push -u origin main
A new window will pop up prompting you to log into GitHub. Log in with your madebyJasonGibson account credentials.
